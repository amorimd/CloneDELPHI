1. INTRODUCTION
   ============

ImpedanceWake2D is a package containing four different codes that compute the longitudinal and transverse
beam coupling impedances and wake functions in a multilayer axisymmetric or flat structure that is two dimensional
(i.e. of infinite length, that is without endings in the longitudinal direction). The number of layers
can be in principle anything, and each of them can be made of any linear material. For now we use fixed frequency
dependent expressions for the complex permittivity and permeability, depending
on 5 parameters (see below), but this limitation can be easily changed, to fit particular needs.
The last layer has an infinite thickness (no perfectly conducting layer in the end).
The code relies on the analytic computation of the electromagnetic fields created by a point-charge beam travelling
at any speed (not necessarily ultrarelativistic) in the whole structure.

For the impedances of a cylindrical structure, the original ideas are from B. Zotter [1-3]. They were previously 
implemented in code called LAWAT [2], later [4,5] converted to a Mathematica [6] notebook. A full 
review of the formalism is in [7]. It was also implemented in a Mathematica notebook called ReWall (can be
found at http://impedance.web.cern.ch/impedance/).

For the impedances of a flat structure, the formalism was developped during N. Mounet's PhD thesis, and is fully 
described in [8].

The theories on both the cylindrical and flat cases is shortly described in [9].

To compute the wake functions (time domain counterparts of the impedances), an algorithm based on a Filon's kind 
of method is used, instead of an FFT. The main advantages are the accuracy and the fact that an uneven frequency 
sampling can be used, which is useful in the case of impedances because they exhibit different features for 
different frequency ranges, i.e. their details over a large number of decades is needed to compute accurately the
wakes. The codes automatically refine the frequency sampling until a prescribed accuracy on the wake function is
reached. The full method is described in N. Mounet's PhD thesis.
 

IMPORTANT NOTE: the impedance computed here is the so-called "wall impedance", which is sligthly different from the
"resistive-wall impedance": the wall impedance contains the indirect space charge term (perfect conducor impedance)
whereas the resistive-wall one doesn't. This is because the indirect space-charge term is crucial for the 
low-frequency behaviour (we cannot easily separate its effect from the resistive part). Details on this concept 
can be found in [10]. The same applies for the wake functions: they also include the indirect space charge. 

NOTE ON PARTICULAR USES: 
- the codes work for any relativistic mass factor gamma (or equivalently for any relativistic 
velocity factor beta). If one wants to use the code in the ultrarelativistic limit, the only possibility is to put a 
very large gamma in the input file. Note anyway that above a certain frequency, the computation will be probably different
from the ultrarelativistic case (this frequency limit certainly increases with gamma).
- there is no perfectly conducting layer (PEC) on the outside. If one wants to put one, one possibility is to put a very
low resistivity on the last layer (e.g. 10^-15 Ohm.m), but some numerical issues could occur, in which case it is advised
to increase the precision (see below).


2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PACKAGE

3. INSTALLATION AND USE
   ====================
   
   The following instructions should be valid for a Linux operating system. They were checked under lxplus at CERN (in 2014)
   and under Ubuntu (10.04 & 12.04), with gcc/g++ compilers.
   
   For other operating systems and/or compilers, the user is welcome to share his/her installation experience by
   sending an email to imp-inst@cern.ch .
   
   For CERN users under lxplus, note that the GMP, MPFR and GSL libraries are already installed, only ALGLIB
   needs to be installed manually (see 3.1).
     
   
   3.1 Prerequisites
       -------------
       
       The codes require four libraries:
       - GMP (http://gmplib.org/), 
       - MPFR (http://www.mpfr.org/),
       - GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/),
       - ALGLIB (http://www.alglib.net/).
       All those libraries are free and under the GNU General Public License.
       
       To check if GMP, MPFR and GSL are already installed, check for the existence of "libgmp", "libmpfr", "libgsl"
       and "libgslcblas" (with extensions .a, .la and/or .so) in /usr/lib/ or /usr/lib64/ or /usr/local/lib/,
       as well as the existence of "gmp.h", "mpfr.h" and the "gsl" directory in /usr/include/ or /usr/local/include/.
       
       Otherwise, or if you are experiencing troubles with some already installed gmp or mpfr libraries
       (apparently it is the case with latest versions and/or under Ubuntu 12.04, due to some TLS problem...):
       
       - go in ../External_libs and follow the instructions in README_compile_GMP_MPFR, to install gmp and mpfr
       locally (remember to do it preferrably outside of this git repository).
       (note: you can also download them from the web; for gmp you need 'lunzip' to be able to extract the archive -
       under Ubuntu simply do "sudo apt-get install lunzip")
       - later (see below), use the Makefile called "Makefile_local_GMP_MPFR"
       
       
       For ALGLIB:
        - download the mpfr version of ALGLIB (2.6) from http://www.alglib.net/translator/re/alglib-2.6.0.mpfr.zip
	- after extraction (with e.g. unzip), compile the library: from the "mpfr" directory of ALGLIB do
	chmod +x build
	./build gcc "-fPIC"
	(-fPIC option is to enable the compilation of a shared library)
	(note: I don't know if other compilers than gcc are supported)
	(full instructions in http://www.alglib.net/translator/man/manual.mpfr.html)
	- check that "mpfr/out/" contains now many .h files and "libmpalglib.a"
	- replace "mpfr.h" in "mpfr/out/" by the one given with this package:
	cp {ImpedanceWake2Ddirectory}/mpfr.h {ALGLIBdirectory}/mpfr/out/
	
	
   3.2 Compilation
       -----------
       
       - If you are under lxplus or if you did not need to install locally GMP and MPFR:
	   * type
	   cp Makefile_lxplus Makefile
	   * edit the file "Makefile" and change the variable PATH_ALGLIB to the local directory where you
	   installed ALGLIB (do not forget /mpfr/out/).
	   
       - If you had to install locally GMP and MPFR (see above):
	   * type
	   cp Makefile_local_GMP_MPFR Makefile
	   * edit the file "Makefile" and
	   	- change the variable PATH_ALGLIB to the local directory where you
	   	installed ALGLIB (do not forget /mpfr/out in the end),
	   	- change the variable PATH_GMP to the local directory where you
	   	installed GMP,
	   	- change the variable PATH_MPFR to the local directory where you
	   	installed MPFR (do not forget /src in the end).
	
	- Finally:
	   * Type "make" (or "make all"),
	   * to erase all the executables and libraries: "make clean".
       
       
   3.3 How to use the code
       -------------------
       
       On the command line, simply type e.g.
       
       ./wake_flatchamber.x < WakeFlatChamberInputFile.txt
       
       if your input file is in WakeFlatChamberInputFile.txt
       (and similar commands for the three other codes).
       
       NOTE: the wake computations codes take much more time than the impedance ones, in general (depending on the
       paramters, of course).
       

   3.4 How to use the library
       ----------------------
       
       The library "libIW2D.so" is used in the Python programs located in 
       ../PYTHON_codes_and_scripts/General_Python_tools/fourier_lib.py
       In order for those to work, you need to add a line to your .bashrc file to add the IW2D path
       to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
       Also, for the Python Impedance library located in
       ../PYTHON_codes_and_scripts/Impedance_lib_Python/Impedance.py
       you need to affect the environment variable IW2D_PATH with the path to the current directory
       (containing all executables needed by Impedance.py)
       
       All this can be simply done by running once the script given in this directory: type
       
       ./script_configure_bashrc.sh
       
       and then logout and log in again, or do
       source ~/.bashrc
       
       But still double-check your .bashrc afterwards, in case ...
       

4. THE INPUT FILES
   ===============

IMPORTANT NOTE: there must ALWAYS be a tab between the parameter description and its value, and more generally the exact 
sentence of the parameter description should be kept identical.

If there are more layers described in the input file than indicated at the 
beginning of it, the additional ones are ignored.

Comments for the output files names:	_some_element


* Description of each parameter:

 - Machine: name of the machine in which the element is located. It's used
only in the output files names.
 - Relativistic Gamma: gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta^2) for the point-charge creating the
electromagnetic fields and impedances.
 - Impedance Length in m: length (along the beam orbit) of the element
considered.
 - Number of layers: number of layers in the multilayer cylindrical structure
considered. For example 1 layer means that around the vacuum region only
one layer of material is considered, with infinite thickness. Typically,
a pipe wall made of a coated material and surrounded by vacuum will have
three layers (coating + main wall material + vacuum). Any number of layers can be treated.
 - Layer 1 inner radius in mm: inner radius of the structure.
 - Layer n DC resistivity (Ohm.m):	DC resistivity rho of the layer considered
(can be Infinity. e.g. for vacuum).
 - Layer n relaxation time for resistivity (ps): relaxation time tau in
picoseconds (BEWARE OF THE UNITS), for the AC conductivity (or
resistivity). 0 for vacuum.
 - Layer n real part of dielectric constant: eps_b (1 for vacuum or metals).
 - Layer n magnetic susceptibility: it is chi_m=mu_r-1 if the permeability is
real. 0 for vacuum.
 - Layer n relaxation frequency of permeability (MHz): f_mu, cut-off frequency for the
frequency-dependent complex permeability. Usually Inifinity (vacuum,
metals, and others).
 - Layer n thickness in mm: thickness of the layer n. Can be Infinity (actually it
has to be Infinity for the last layer).

The 6 previous items are repeated for all the layers, changing the number
n from 1 to "Number of layers" (specified at the beginning). There can be 
more layers than needed (i.e. than "Number of layers") in the input file, 
it is not a problem.
In summary, the total complex permittivity in each layer is:
eps_c = eps_0 * eps_b + 1/(j*rho*2*pi*f*(1+j*2*pi*f*tau))
and the permeability is:
mu = mu_0 * (1 + chi_m/(1+j*f/f_mu) )
where f is the frequency, eps_0 the vacuum permittivity and mu_0 its
permeability.

 - start frequency exponent (10^) in Hz: fmin: the scan (see flag below) in 
frequency for the impedance calculation begins at 10^fmin Hz
 - stop  frequency exponent (10^) in Hz: fmax: the scan (see flag below) in 
frequency for the impedance calculation ends at 10^fmax Hz
 - linear (1) or logarithmic (0) or both (2) frequency scan: flag for the 
frequency sampling to be used: if it's 1, a linear (evenly spaced) scan is performed,
if it's 0 it's a logarithmically spaced scan, if it's 2, we use
both (a logarithmic scan plus a linear refinement, usually to sample
accurately the high-frequency peak).
 - sampling frequency exponent (10^) in Hz (for linear): when option 1 is
selected above, the scan goes from 10^fmin to 10^fmax with a spacing of
10^"sampling frequency exponent".
 - Number of points per decade (for log): when option 0 or 2 is selected
above, the scan goes from 10^fmin to 10^fmax with this number of points
per decades.
 - when both, fmin of the refinement (in THz):	fminref
 - when both, fmax of the refinement (in THz):	fmaxref
 - when both, number of points in the refinement:	nref
When the option above is 2, the last three parameters define an additional
linear scan of nref points from fminref to fmaxref (BEWARE of UNITS:
THZ). It is added to the log scan previously defined, sorting all the 
frequencies in ascending order (also, if some frequencies
appear twice, the redundant ones are erased).
 - added frequencies [Hz]:	several individual frequencies (separated by 
spaces in the input file) to be added to all the previously defined scan.
It can be empty.
 - Yokoya factors long, xdip, ydip, xquad, yquad: 5 values (separated by
spaces) giving the factors to apply to get the final impedances and wakes.
Basically, the code computes the longitudinal and transverse dipolar impedance
of a cylindrical geometry, and apply those factors to get the long., dip. and quad. impedance
for another geometry. First value is for the longitudinal term, second one for the dipolar x
transverse term, third one for the dipolar y transverse term,
fourth one for the quadrupolar x transverse term, and fifth one for the
quadrupolar y transverse terms. NOTE: in the cylindrical case (Yokoya factors="1 1 1 0 0"), we take into
account the non-ultrarelativistic axisymmetric quadrupolar impedance (new
quadrupolar impedance, see [7]), such that the quadrupolar impedance is not zero.
 - Comments for the output files names: additional string
that will be added at the end of the output file name. It can be empty.

factor weighting the longitudinal impedance error:	1.
tolerance (in wake units) to achieve:	1.e11
frequency above which the mesh bisecting is linear [Hz]:	1.e11
Comments for the output files names:


* Description of each parameter:

 - The first parameters, up to the last layer thickness, are the same as for the round chamber
imepdance (see 4.1),
 - linear (1) or logarithmic (0) or both (2) scan in z for the wake: same
kind of flag as above: we can perform either a purely linear scan (1), a
purely logarithmic scan (0), or both (2). Note that the scan is over z, the
distance (in m) BEHIND the travelling point-charge. Negative values can
be entered in principle (meaning that we look for the wake in front of the beam).
 - sampling distance in m for the linear sampling:     distance between two
points for the linear sampling.
 - zmin in m of the linear sampling: first point of the linear sampling.
 - zmax in m of the linear sampling: last point of the linear sampling.
 - Number of points per decade for the logarithmic sampling: self
explanatory.
 - exponent (10^) of zmin (in m) of the logarithmic sampling: the log
scan begins at 10^"this value".
 - exponent (10^) of zmax (in m) of the logarithmic sampling: the log
scan ends at 10^"this value".
 - added z [m]: as above for frequencies: individual z values to be
entered in the scan.
As for the frequency scan, the final scan is sorted and duplicates are
erased.
 - Yokoya factors long, xdip, ydip, xquad, yquad: see above in 4.1
 - factor weighting the longitudinal impedance error: to reach convergence
on the wake functions, an error between the analytical impedances and its
interpolation is integrated over the frequency range. This parameter is a factor
weighting the error on the longitudinal impedance in the total error computation. It's useful to put a high value
(100 or even 1000) if one wants to get an accurate longitudinal wake, because otherwise,
since the transverse impedances are numerically usually much higher than the longitudinal one,
the error on the longitudinal impedance is rather negligible in the integration, and therefore
in the convergence process.
 - tolerance (in wake units) to achieve: this is the absolute error one wants to reach
for the wake calculation. The code refines the frequency mesh used to compute the impedance
until the error is less than this. Note that this is approximate only, the final wake functions
error may still be above this parameter. Nevertheless, the lower it is, the more accurate will be the wake,
and the longer it will take the code to reach convergence. A rule of thumb is to choose
a few times below the minimum value the wake is likely to reach on the chosen z mesh. 
 - frequency above which the mesh bisecting is linear [Hz]: above this frequency, the refinement
procedure bisects linearly the frequency intervals, whereas below it bisects them
logarithmically. Changing this parameter does not matter too much. For ceramic structures, or more
generally structures having lots of resonant peaks, one can try to put it lower (e.g. 1e9) because
the resonant peaks are usually with equal frequencies between them.

Comments for the output files names:


* Description of each parameter:

See the round case above (4.1), except for:
 - Number of upper layers in the chamber wall: number of layers in the upper part of the chamber.
 - Layer 1 inner half gap in mm: position on the vertical axis of the chamber first upper layer, 
 with respect to the beam orbit.
 - Top bottom symmetry (yes or no): if "yes", the lower part of the chamber is exactly the same as
the upper part, defined as in the round case (see 4.1) with the lines "Layer n ...". If "no", the
chamber is asymetrical and one needs to define the lower part of the chamber, with the following
lines:
 - Number of lower layers in the chamber wall: number of layers in the lower part of the chamber.
 - Layer -1 inner half gap in mm: position (in absolute value, i.e. >=0) on the vertical axis of the 
chamber first lower layer, with respect to the beam orbit.
 - Layer -n DC resistivity (Ohm.m): DC resistivity rho of the n^th layer in the lower part 
of the chamber (can be Infinity. e.g. for vacuum).
 - Layer -n relaxation time for resistivity (ps): relaxation time tau in
picoseconds (BEWARE OF THE UNITS), for the AC conductivity (or
resistivity). 0 for vacuum.
 - Layer -n real part of dielectric constant: eps_b (1 for vacuum or metals).
 - Layer -n magnetic susceptibility: it is chi_m=mu_r-1 if the permeability is
real. 0 for vacuum.
 - Layer -n relaxation frequency of permeability (MHz): f_mu, cut-off frequency for the
frequency-dependent complex permeability. Usually Inifinity (vacuum,
metals, and others).
 - Layer -n thickness in mm: thickness (positive) of the n^th layer in the lower part 
 of the chamber. Can be Infinity (actually it has to be Infinity for the last layer).

Layer -1 to -n are working the same way as layers 1 to n (note that layers 1 and -1 are the closest
to the beam, and layers n and -n the farthest).
Note that the number of layers in the upper or lower part can be zero.

5. THE OUTPUT FILES
   ================

The output files (ascii files) are put in the directory from which the code is launched.
In each case, one of the output file (name begins with "InputData") is a repetition of the input file.
The first line of the impedance or wake output files contains columns headers with the description and unit
of each column. All units are SI units. The output files have all the .dat extension.
 
NOTE: the impedances (resp. wakes) are sorted with respect to ascending frequencies (resp. distances).
it is possible that some duplicate points remain in the output files (this can cause problems later when using
the files, for instance in a python or matlab interpolation routine).

For the wake computation, the code prints on the standard output the iterations to get the prescribed accuracy on
the wake functions. This can be quite long.


   5.1 Output files for the round chamber impedance computation
       --------------------------------------------------------
       
       There are 5 output files, with three columns each: frequency, impedance real part,
       impedance imaginary part.
       
       Files are: longitudinal (begins with Zlong), x dipolar (Zxdip), y dipolar (Zydip), x quadrupolar
       (Zxquad) and y quadrupolar (Zyquad) impedances.

       There are 10 impedances output files, with three columns each: frequency, impedance real part,
       impedance imaginary part. 5 files are with the (supposedly) converged frequency mesh,
       and 5 files (with "_precise.dat" in the end) are with a finer mesh (twice more frequencies).
       
       There are also 10 wake functions output files, with two columns each: distance behind
       the source, and wake function. 5 files are computed with the (supposedly) converged frequency mesh,
       and 5 files (with "_precise.dat" in the end) with a finer mesh (twice more frequencies).

   5.5 How to plot the output files
       ----------------------------

       You can use the python routines provided to plot the impedances and wakes (round or flat).
       python2.6 with numpy and pylab need to be installed. The routines can be launched in the
       command line.
       
       Examples:
       
       ./plot_Imp_flat.py -f ZlongWLHC_2layersup_0layersdown6.50mm_precise.dat -g "first case" 
       -f ZlongWLHC_2layers18.38mm_precise.dat -g "second case" -l
       
       This will plot in log-log scale all the impedances ending with "WLHC_2layersup_0layersdown6.50mm_precise.dat"
       (long., x dip, y dip, x quad, y quad) , and all
       ending with "WLHC_2layers18.38mm_precise.dat", putting on the same plot the longitudinal
       impedances together, the x dipolar impedances together, etc., with the legends "first case" and 
       "second case" on the graphs.
       
       ./plot_Wake_flat.py -f WlongWLHC_2layersup_0layersdown6.50mm_precise.dat -g "first case" 
       -f WlongWLHC_2layers18.38mm_precise.dat -g "second case" -l
       
       This will plot in log-log scale all the wakes ending with "WLHC_2layersup_0layersdown6.50mm_precise.dat"
       (long., x dip, y dip, x quad, y quad, and y cst if -c option is present) , and all
       ending with "WLHC_2layers18.38mm_precise.dat", putting on the same plot the longitudinal
       wakes together, the x dipolar wakes together, etc., with the legends "first case" and "second case" on
       the graphs.
       

       Short description of the options:
       -l (optional): plot in log-log scale (instead of semilogx for impedances and semilogy for wakes)
       -m (optional): units on the y axis are divided by meter (i.e. impedances & wakes are given per meter length)
       -c (optional): also plots the constant term (for flat asymmetrical chamber)
       -f: longitudinal file to be plotted (needs to begin by Zlong for plot_Imp_flat.py, or Wlong for
       plot_Wake_flat.py). There can be as many files as desired. The transverse impedances and wakes are loaded
       automatically (replacing e.g. Zlong by Zxdip, Zydip, etc.)
       -g (optional): legend to be associated with each file above (otherwise the name of the file is put 
       in the legends).
       -o (option): if used, all plots are directly put into files named e.g. Zlong[this_option].png, 
       Zlong[this_option].eps, Zxdip[this_option].png, etc., instead of printing them on the screen.
       This option is particularly useful if you use a local matplotlib without GUI (so without interactive plots)
       because then the default behaviour (printing on the screen) will fail.
       
       When computing the wakes, it is usually a good idea to compare the converged wake functions with the
       "precise" ones (ending with "_precise.dat"), to check the accuracy of the convergence: if there is not
       too much difference between the two wakes, it's OK. Typically one would need to launch:
       
       ./plot_Wake_flat.py -f WlongWLHC_2layersup_0layersdown6.50mm_precise.dat -g "more precise wake" 
       -f WlongWLHC_2layersup_0layersdown6.50mm.dat -g "converged wake" -l
       
       Note: when curves are superimposed so undistinguishable, it is easy to change one of the plot pattern
       to take out the solid line and put instead for instance some crosses ('x') or circles ('o').
       To do so go in the code of the function plot_Imp_flat.py or plot_Wake_flat.py and change the line
       
       color=['b','r','g','m','c','y','k'];
       
       into (for example)
       
       color=['b','xr','g','m','c','y','k'];
       
       
              

6. TROUBLESHOOTING
   ===============
 
   The codes use floating point numbers with higher precision than doubles or even quadruple precision numbers.
   This is required by the field matching problem resolution where very small and very high numbers appear.
   This is also why we had to use the ALGLIB library (linear algebra with high precision floating point numbers).
   
   In the round chamber computations, problems can arise due to the lack of accuracy when computing the 4*4
   matrices, in particular due to a lack of precision of the modified Bessel functions.
   In the flat case, some problems might arise when performing the numerical integration (with GSL).
   
   In both cases, this is most often solved by increasing the precision of all the calculations. To do so, in
   the code that you use, you can change the line beginning with
   
   #define  Precision
   
   by increasing the number after "Precision" (this is the number of bits for the mantissa of all numbers).
   Please note that putting a too high value will slow down a lot the code, and can also create other problems.
   
   
   Note that the longitudinal wake function is often quite noisy (because it is quite small), as well as the 
   quadrupolar wake functions for round chambers (when putting the Yokoya factors to "1 1 1 0 0"). Try to decrease
   the tolerance on the wake convergence, in case this is an issue (see input files description).
 
  
7. LATEST MODIFICATIONS
   ====================

   - Added the compilation of the shared library (to be used by 
   ../PYTHON_codes_and_scripts/General_Python_tools/fourier_lib.py).
   
   - Added option -o in plotting routines, to allow plot in files rather than on the screen.
   Also improved a bit the plot layout.
   
8. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS (TO-DO LIST)
   ================================
   
   - Round chamber impedances and wakes: better implementation of the modified Bessel functions computation: now we use simply the
   Taylor series for small arguments, and the asymptotic expansion for large arguments. A Chebyshev approximation
   would be better in the intermediate range.
   
   - More modular programs (putting common subroutines in a separate module, instead of repeating them in each 
   code).
   
   - Include the possibility to have the "perfect conductor" and "perfect magnet" kinds of boundary conditions
   for the last layer.
