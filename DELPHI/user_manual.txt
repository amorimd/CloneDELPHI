1. INTRODUCTION
   ============

Instabilites in circular machines (synchrotrons, colliders, accelerators, storage rings, etc.)
due to beam-coupling impedance can be a strong limit to their operation.

This code computes eigenfrequencies (equivalently, complex tuneshifts) of modes that
can develop in circular machines under the combined action of a beam-coupling impedance and
a damper (either bunch-by-bunch or with a certain frequency dependent gain).

Modes exhibiting a tune shift with a negative imaginary part are unstable, their growth rate 
being proportional to this imaginary part.

The code is a Vlasov solver, actually trying to solve Sacherer integral equation (See Ref.[1], Eq. 6.179)
written as an eigenvalue problem:
	- using a decomposition over orthogonal Laguerre polynomials of the radial function
	(idea originally from Besnier [2], used then by Y. Chin in code MOSES [3]),
	- including azimuthal & radial modes, and mode coupling (like MOSES),
	- including generalization to any kind of impedance and to multibunch effects
	(equidistant bunches only - see Ref.[4]),
	- including the effect of a damper, either bunch-by bunch or with a
	frequency dependent gain, as was also done in Refs.[5-6],
	- not including Landau damping.

More information on the theory behind the DELPHI code can be found in Ref.[7].


IMPORTANT NOTICE:
	- the library that you will compile here (libDELPHI.so) is used by the Python tools 
	in ../PYTHON_codes_and_scripts/DELPHI_Python/
	which have been used and benchmarked quite significantly. So it should be reliable.
	
	- BUT the stand-alone you will also compile (DELPHI.x) is much more hazardous
	since it has not been use for a while and might well be BUGGY.
	
	So please be cautious using the stand-alone. If you find bugs or problems, please 
	report them to imp-inst@cern.ch

3. INSTALLATION AND USE
   ====================
   
   The following instructions should be valid for a Linux operating system. They were checked under lxplus at CERN (in 2014)
   and under Ubuntu (10.04 & 12.04), with gcc/g++ compilers .
   
   For other operating systems and/or compilers, the user is welcome to share his/her installation experience by
   sending an email to imp-inst@cern.ch .
   
   For CERN users under lxplus, note that the LAPACK, BLAS and GSL libraries are already installed.
     
   
   3.1 Prerequisites
       -------------
       
       The codes require four libraries:
       - LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack), 
       - BLAS (http://www.netlib.org/blas),
       - GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/),
       All those libraries are free.
       
       To check if LAPACK, BLAS and GSL are already installed, check for the existence of "liblapack",
       "libblas", "libgsl" and "libgslcblas" (with extensions .a, .la and/or .so) in /usr/lib/ or /usr/lib64/ or /usr/local/lib/,
       as well as the existence of the "gsl" directory in /usr/include/ or /usr/local/include/.
       
       Otherwise, follow installation instructions in each of the missing library website (see above).
       Note that under Ubuntu, you can simply do:
       		*for GSL:
       		sudo apt-get install gsl-bin libgsl0-dev
       		*for BLAS/LAPACK:
       		sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
		
      
	
   3.2 Compilation
       -----------
       
       - Type "make" (or "make all"),
       - to erase all the executables and libraries: "make clean".
       
       
   3.3 How to use the code
       -------------------
       
       On the command line, simply type e.g.
       
       ./DELPHI.x < input.dat
       
       if your input file is in input.dat
       
       NOTE: the code can be instantaneous or take hours, depending on the number of bunches / number of
       coupled-bunch modes / use of trapz method or not / convergence criterion / use of damper or not / bunch length, etc.
       
   
   3.4 How to use the library
       ----------------------
       
       The library "libDELPHI.so" is used in the Python programs located in 
       ../PYTHON_codes_and_scripts/DELPHI_Python/
       In order for those to work, you need to add a line to your .bashrc file to add the DELPHI path
       to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
       This can be simply done by running once the script given in this directory: type
       
       ./script_configure_bashrc.sh
       
       But still double-check your .bashrc, afterwards, in case...

       

4. THE INPUT FILES
   ===============

IMPORTANT NOTE: there must ALWAYS be a tab between the parameter description and its value, and more generally the exact 
sentence of the parameter description should be kept identical. On the other hand, the order of the lines
does not matter.
       
* Input file example:

* Description of each parameter:

 - Impedance filename: name of the file containing the dipolar impedance (3 columns, without header: 
 frequency - NOT ANGULAR, real part of the impedance and imaginary part). It should be sorted in 
 ascending order of frequencies. Frequencies should be positive.

 - Longitudinal distribution filename: file containing the initial longitudinal distribution, in 
 terms of coefficients over an expansion on Laguerre polynomials
 g0(tau)= exp(-b*tau^2/taub^2) sum_(k=0)^N g_k L_k(a*tau^2/taub^2)
 (for Gaussian, use "no" -> only one term, a can be whatever, b=8 - input file value overridden 
 if different from 8, and g0= 8/(pi*taub^2) with taub the full bunch length (4 RMS) (Laclare's conventions)

 - Damper impedance filename: either "no" (no filename, bunch-by-bunch damper assumed), 
 or name of the file containing the damper impedance (i.e. frequency dependent gain) (3 columns, 
 without headers: frequency - NOT ANGULAR, real part and imag. part of the impedance). It should be 
 sorted in ascending order of frequencies. Frequencies should span both positive and negative domain.
 
 - Output filename: eigenvalues are put in [this_filename]_val.dat, eigenvectors in [this_filename]_vec.dat.

 - Total bunch length: bunch length ins seconds (for Gaussian bunches, this is 4*RMS)

 - Number of particles per bunch: bunch intensity,

 - Machine circumference: circumference in m (2*pi*machine_radius),

 - Relativistic gamma: relativistic mass factor,

 - Transverse tune: unperturbed tune in the plane considered. Note that DELPHI assumes
 beta=machine_radius/Q (to be taken into account when normalizing the impedance, before launching DELPHI)

 - Synchrotron tune: Qs,
 
 - Type of particle: proton or electron.

 - Chromaticity (DeltaQ*p/Q*Deltap): xi (not Q') -> DeltatQ=xi*Q*Deltap/p

 - Momentum compaction factor: alpha_p=1:gamma_transition^2

 - Number of bunches: M: there are M equidistant bunches in the ring,
 
 - Maximum number of eigenvalues: kmax: total number of eigenvalues that are kept and accurate within 
 "Convergence criterion" (see below) (the code chooses the ones with the lowest imaginary part, i.e.
 the most unstable ones)

 - Minimum coupled-bunch mode number to consider: nxmin: we compute modes of number between nxmin 
 and M-1 (total number of bunches minus one)

 - Maximum coupled-bunch mode number to consider: nxmax: we also compute modes of number between 0 
 and nxmax

 - Coupled-bunch modes added: we also compute those additional modes

 - Maximum damper gain in 1/nturns units: dmax: gain of the damper, expressed as a 
 damping rate=1/(nb damping turns), 
 for mode 0 at 0 chromaticity. Note: this is used to normalize the damper matrix also when using a
 damper impedance function rather than a bunch-by-bunch ideal damper.

 - Frequency cutoff of damper: used with frequency-dependent damper gain: above this cutoff
 the gain is assumed to be exactly zero.
 
 - Damper phase w.r.t. pi/2: dphase: additional phase added to the damper. zero means an "usual" damper
 (resistive, i.e. counteracting the growth rate i.e. the real part of the impedance).
 dphase=+/- pi/2 is a reactive damper (counteracting the tune shift). all other values can be used.

 - a and b: parameters for the initial longitudinal distribution (see above) and the Laguerre expansion
 of the modes. Can play with them  to make the code run faster (with a=b formulas are simpler but 
 convergence might be slower).

 - Use trapz method: "no" to perform the impedance sum with "brute force", "yes" to try to speed it up 
 by replacing part of it with an integral. Accuracy is the same, "no" 
 will be better with large number of bunches, "yes" is better in single-bunch (when betatron sidebands are 
 very close to each other within the bunch spectrum).

NOTE: trapz method and gsl integration (now commented in the code) give the same results 
(same coupling matrix, same eigenvalues, up to the 4th digit at least for the cases checked).
But trapz method is about 6 times faster (for the same precision in impedancesum)...

 - Convergence criterion: crit: maximum error on the imaginary part of the kmax most unstable modes, 
 between the current and the previous matrices diagonalized. This is for the convergence loop
 vs. the matrix size.

 - (optional) Maximum number of radial modes: nbrad: if used with max_azim, do not take into account 
 convergence criterion and compute nbrad radial modes only.

 - (optional) Maximum azimuthal mode number: max_azim: if used with nbrad, do not take into account 
 convergence criterion and compute azimuthal modes from -max_azim to +max_azim.



5. THE OUTPUT FILES
   ================

The output files (ascii files) are put in the directory from which the code is launched.

The code also prints on the standard output a repetition of the input file, then the number of
coupled_bunch modes computed, then the iterations on the matrix sizeto get 
to the prescribed accuracy on the eigenvalues (or to the maximum number of modes
indicated in nbrad & max_azim, see above). Convergence can be quite long in some cases
(in particular with damper).


   5.1 Output files for the eigenvalues
       --------------------------------
       
  - [output_filename]_val.dat: eigenvalues Deltaomega (complex betatron 
 angular frequency shift w.r.t. the unperturbed tune), array of size Mc*kmax
 (Mc multibunch modes, kmax eigenvalues).
 It is an ascii file with the array written in "blocks". 
 Each coupled-bunch mode is clearly identified, and for each of them:
 	* the number of radial modes and the maximum azimuthal mode used are given, as well as the
 	precision reached (max. relative difference between 2 last steps on the imag. part of the kmax
 	converged eigenvalues). 
	* the kmax most unstable eigenvalues are given (most unstable first).
       

   5.2 Output files for the eigenvectors
       ---------------------------------
       
  - [output_filename]_vect.dat: complex eigenvectors for each eigenvalue above, array of size 
  Mc*kmax*(2*mmax+1)*nmax
 (component on nth radial mode of the mth headtail mode of the kth most unstable 
 eigenvalue of the Mth multibunch mode).
 It is an ascii file with the array written in "blocks". 
 Each coupled-bunch mode is clearly identified, and for each of them:
 	* the number of radial modes and the maximum azimuthal mode used are given, as well as the
 	precision reached (max. relative difference between 2 last steps on the imag. part of the kmax
 	converged eigenvalues). 
	* the kmax most unstable eigenvalues are given (most unstable first). For each of them, an array
	of size (2*mmax+1)*nmax is provided (first the 6 radial components of the -mmax azimuthal component,
	then the 6 radial components of the -mmax+1 azimuthal component, etc.)
       
       
              

6. TROUBLESHOOTING
   ===============
 
   If the size of the matrix to diagonalize become too bg, the code will crash. Try to decrease the
   number of converged eigenvalues, or to increase the convergence criterion. 
  

7. LATEST MODIFICATIONS
   ====================


8. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS (TO-DO LIST)
   ================================
   
   - Check the code vs. the python library, just in case...

   - Do some Python plotting routines to plot the modes (in a "HEADTAIL way", with the nodes...). 
   There is Hankel transform to do or something like that (Laclare [4], as well as Elias 
   Metral 2009 USPAS courses, might be useful for that...).
