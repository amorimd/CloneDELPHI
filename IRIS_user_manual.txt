1. INTRODUCTION
   ============

Instabilites in circular machines (synchrotrons, colliders, accelerators, storage rings, etc.)
due to beam-coupling impedance can be a strong limit to their operation.
This package provides a rather self-consistent set of tools to study beam coupling impedances
and their effects in such rings.
The C++ codes DELPHI, ImpedanceWake2D and Laclare are independent from
each other, but the Python codes are at the end of the chain and use most 
of the C++ codes and external libraries provided here (except Laclare).
 

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PACKAGE
   ==========================

This repository contains various codes and scripts to compute impedance and instabilities, 
written in PYTHON and C++, in particular:

	- DELPHI: C++ code (stand-alone and shared library) to compute eigenfrequencies 
	(tuneshifts and growth rates) of modes for a coupling-impedance/damper system 
	(Vlasov solver), in mode-coupling regime (azimuthal and radial modes considered)
	
	- ImpedanceWake2D: C++ code (stand-alone and shared library) to compute resistive-wall
	impedance & wake functions of flat or round multilayer infinitely long ("2D") structures,

	- Laclare: C++ code (stand-alone) to compute eigenfrequencies (tuneshifts and growth 
	rates) from a coupling-impedance alone, in weak headtail (low intensity) regime,
	using Laclare formalism (see J. L. Laclare, "Bunched Beam Coherent Instabilities", 
	CERN-87-03-V-1, p. 264, 1987).

	- PYTHON_codes_and_scripts: many Python codes and scripts:
	
		* Impedance python library: library to compute impedance models, including a 
		wrapper for ImpedanceWake2D,
		* DELPHI python library: library to compute instabilities for a 
		coupling-impedance/damper system (wrapper of DELPHI) (also contains a wrapper 
		for the MOSES code of Y. Chin, and several other functions),
		* Some general purpose python modules used in many of the functions and scripts here,
		* HEADTAIL pre and postprocessing scripts (compatible with HEADTAIL 
		multibunch version) ,
		* Data analysis scripts (particularly adapted to LHC Timber data, but also to PS & 
		PSB matlab files obtained in a "Guido Sterbini" way),
		* LHC & HL-LHC impedance model generation (including data files with parameters and 
		beta functions), and scripts for complex tuneshifts computation,
		* Other machines (SPS, LEP, TLEP, VHE-LHC, ALBA, VEPP) scripts to compute 
		complex tuneshifts, and sometimes impedance models
		* Other python tools,
	
	- External_libs: 
		* External python modules (numpy, scipy and matplotlib) in a version compatible with the content of the repository,
		* External GMP and MPFR libraries for the ImpedanceWake2D code (used by ALGLIB, see below).
		* External ALGLIB library for the ImpedanceWake2D code (C++ library for computations with high precision numbers).

	- SUSSIX: Sussix code (see R. Bartolini - F. Schmidt, CERN SL/Note 98-017 (AP) - 1998)
	for high accuracy spectral analysis, with python wrappers from Rogelio Tomas & Benoit
	Salvant. It is used in particular by the data analysis scripts and the HEADTAIL 
	postprocessing scripts (see above).

	- Getting_LHC_beta_functions: a collection of MAD-X and Matlab® scripts to easily 
	extract (from optics files in the official repositories) and compute beta functions
	for all elements defined in the LHC & HL-LHC impedance models (used to obtain beta 
	functions in files contained in 
	PYTHON_codes_and_scripts/LHC_impedance_and_scripts/LHC_elements).
	There are also functions to get the octupole detuning coefficients (and Q'').


3. INSTALLATION AND USE
   ====================
   
   The package was tested on Linux machines only (lxplus at CERN, in 2014, and 
   Ubuntu 10.04 & 12.04).
   
   For other operating systems, the user is welcome to share his/her installation experience 
   by sending an email to imp-inst@cern.ch
        
   
   3.1 Prerequisites
       -------------
       
       - python 2.6 or 2.7 (other versions - in particular more recent - were not tested).
       - g++ and gcc compilers, with standard C++ libraries. Other compilers have not
       tried, but the user is welcome to share his/her experience with other compilers by sending
       an email to imp-inst@cern.ch
       
	
   3.2 Installation
       -----------
       
       To download toe the CERN GIT repository, install GIT ("sudo apt-get install git-core"
       under Ubuntu) and do
       git clone https://nmounet@git.cern.ch/kerberos/IRIS
       or
       git clone https://nmounet@git.cern.ch/reps/IRIS
       (the former requires MIT Kerberos to be installed, most probably).
       This creates a directory IRIS in the current directory, with the full package in it.
       
       
       Each part of the package has its own installation procedure: 
       
	- DELPHI: follow the instructions in DELPHI/DELPHI_user_manual.txt
		
	- ImpedanceWake2D: follow the instructions in ImpedanceWake2D/IW2D_user_manual.txt

	- Laclare: follow the instructions in Laclare/Laclare_user_manual.txt

	- External_libs: 
		* Python modules (numpy, scipy and matplotlib):
			- they might be needed by the Python programs
			(particularly under lxplus at CERN)
			- in that case, follow the instructions in External_libs/README_install_pymodules.txt
		
		* GMP and MPFR (used by ImpedanceWake2D):
			- see first in ImpedanceWake2D/IW2D_user_manual.txt if they are needed,
			- if they are needed follow the instructions in External_libs/README_compile_GMP_MPFR.txt
		
		* ALGLIB (used by ImpedanceWake2D):
			- install first GMP and MPFR if needed (check in ImpedanceWake2D/IW2D_user_manual.txt)
			- follow the instructions in ImpedanceWake2D/IW2D_user_manual.txt

	- SUSSIX:
		* check that f2py is present in /usr/bin
		If it is not there or if you have troubles, you can try to use
		the one provided with numpy:
			~ install numpy from External_libs (see above)
			~ in SUSSIX/Sussix/Makefile, replace /usr/bin/f2py by
			[numpy_install_directory]/bin/f2py[python_version_number]
			
			where [numpy_install_directory] is the directory where you installed numpy
			(e.g. ../../External_libs/numpy-install)
			and [python_version_number] is your python version number (e.g. 2.6)
		* do:
		cd  SUSSIX/Sussix
		make
		chmod +x getTuneSussixNM.py

	- PYTHON_codes_and_scripts: 
	
		* Impedance python library:
		* DELPHI python library: 
		* Some general purpose python modules used in many of the functions and scripts here,
		* HEADTAIL pre and postprocessing scripts 
		* Data analysis scripts 
		* LHC & HL-LHC impedance model generation 
		* Other machines 
		* Other python tools,
	
	- Getting_LHC_beta_functions: nothing to install, but in case one wants to run matlab (*.m)
	files, one needs Matlab® (commercial software, http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
	while for madx scripts one would need MAD-X (free, http://madx.web.cern.ch/madx/)
       
       
   3.3 How to use the codes
       --------------------
       
       The main codes of the repository are in the subdirectories DELPHI, 
       ImpedanceWake2D, Laclare and in PYTHON_codes_and_scripts.
       
       For each of them, go in the corresponding subdirectory and follow the user
       manual.
       
       For SUSSIX, you can make a test (on the HEADTAIL center of mass output
       "HEADTAIL_test_prt.dat") with the command-line example in 
       "example_getTune.txt".
       
       To get beta functions for the LHC or octupole coefficients, have a look at 
       "Getting_LHC_beta_functions/README.txt". 

   
4. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS (TO-DO LIST)
   ================================

- Make nicer (html) user manuals (using sphinx for instance - it should be easy
to change all .txt files into .rst files).
