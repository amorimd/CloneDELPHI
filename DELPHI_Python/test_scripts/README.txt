# to run this example of use of DELPHI with tunespread (that is not working very well yet) you can simply do
./test_DELPHI_tunespread.py
# or
./test_DELPHI_tunespread.py launch launch
# then (after jobs are finished)
./test_DELPHI_tunespread.py retrieve launch
# then (after jobs are finished)
./test_DELPHI_tunespread.py retrieve retrieve


# run this only to test if the DELPHI library is generally working (no missing path
# or this kind of issues), but BEWARE THAT RESULTS ARE PROBABLY VERY STRANGE
# (and not really understandable) from this test.
