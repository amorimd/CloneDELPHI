    MOSES_wrapper(rootname, Rres, fres, Qres, Qpscan, Nbscan, omegasscan, omega0, E, alphap, sigmaz, avbeta, lmax, nmax, mmin=-3, mmax=3, taumin=-0.5, taumax=0.5, firstline='MOSES input file #', action='launch', MOSES_exec=r'~/DFS/Documents/MOSES4W/MOSES\ application\ for\ Windows/MOSES4W.exe', direname_local='DFS', dirname_remote='//cernhomeN.cern.ch/m/mounet', flag_win=True)
        Wrapper to produce easily input files for MOSES (https://oraweb.cern.ch/pls/hhh/code_website.disp_code?code_name=MOSES), from scanned parameters.
        MOSES is a code to compute instabilities, written by Y. Chin (Y. H. Chin. User's Guide for New MOSES Version 2.0 ,
        CERN/LEP-TH/88-05, 1988) that works in a similar way as DELPHI (single-bunch, resonator impedance only, with Landau damping).
        You need to have installed the executable in the path 'MOSES_exec'. This is specially
        designed for a MOSES executable working under Windows, in a directory accessible from here (typically, on a mounted
        DFS file system).
        
        This wrapper, depending on 'action', either writes MOSES input files for scanned parameters and write a Windows batch file
        to launch all the calculations (you still have to launch calculations by hand), or 
        retrieve the MOSES output to get tuneshifts.
        Inputs:
         - rootname: root (including path) of the final input and batch filenames,
         - Rres, fres, Qres: transverse shunt impedance, resonance frequency and quality factor
           for the resonator impedance model. Each (or all) of them can be a list of values, or a scalar.
         - Qpscan: list of chromaticity (Q') to scan,
         - Nbscan: list of number of particles to scan (actually, each value is not used, but only
           the number of values, the first and the last ones, i.e. it makes a linear sampling between
           the first and last number of particles in Nbscan, with min(len(Nbscan),120) points),
         - omegasscan: list of omegas (synchrotron angular frequency in rad/s) to scan,
         - omega0: angular revolution frequency in rad/s,
         - E: energy in eV,
         - alphap: momentum compaction factor,
         - sigmaz: bunch length in m,
         - avbeta: average beta function in m (actually R/Q),
         - lmax: maximum azimuthal mode number to consider (we go from -lmax to +lmax),
         - nmax: number of radial mode -1 (0 means 1 radial mode),
         - mmin & mmax: minimum and maximum for the y-axis of MOSES TMCI plot for the 
           real part of the tune shift / Qs,
         - taumin & taumax: minimum and maximum for the y-axis of MOSES TMCI plot for the 
           imaginary part of the tune shift / Qs,
         - firstline: first line of MOSES input files (some comment),
         - action: 'launch' or 'retrieve': either write input file + Win. bat file to launch 
           all of them easily, or read output and give tuneshifts.
         - MOSES_exec: local path where to find MOSES' executable (Unix path).
         - direname_local: local directory name in which the remote file system is mounted (do not include
         the ~/ or /home/[username]/, just put the bare directory name or path from ~/).
         - dirname_remote: remote directory name to which direname_local corresponds (NOTE: you can keep
         the '/' like this, for Windows paths the replacement by '' will be done automatically - see next flag).
         - flag_win: True if remote path is a Windows path; then all '/' are replaced by ''.
        Outputs:
           all modes tuneshifts, tuneshifts of mode 0, and Iscan (arrays)

        Write an HEADTAIL input file (.cfg)
        Parameters are the same (and in the same order) as in the .cfg file, except that:
        - units are all SI except prate in GeV/c/s (but nsigmaz, xkick and ykick are still in number of sigmas,
        and spacing in RF buckets),
        - number of macroparticles=nMP_per_sl*nsl.
        cfgname contains the name of the input file (with extension).
        Default values are typical of 2012 LHC operation at 4TeV (except detuning and Qsec).
