#################################################################################
# Script examples
#################################################################################

# All the other python files here are scripts that can be run from the command line,
# performing certain kinds of Impedance and/or DELPHI computations.
#
# They have to be taken as mere examples; in particular, the oldest ones 
# do not use the latest and highest level DELPHI wrapping functions and can be quite
# inefficient, or even crash. For instance, some might look for HEADTAIL simulation
# files which are local files in N. Mounet workspace; you have to comment/take out
# the corresponding lines (see also below).

# In principle a new script has to be done for any new kind of computation, and these
# examples can serve as starting points.

# If one wants to launch a test, the simplest and also most recent script is

LHC_compare.py

# Then the most recent script for the LHC impedance model predictions (including stability
limits) is:
LHC_new_postLS1.py

# For HL-LHC it is:
LHC_HLLHC_new_comp_imp.py

# To launch the scripts on a LSF batch system (like lxplus), the procedure is
# (e.g. here with LHC_compare):
# first type
./LHC_compare.py launch launch
#
# -> this launches the resistive-wall impedance computations on batch jobs
#
# then when all jobs are finished (and if none crashed)
./LHC_compare.py retrieve launch
#
# -> this retrieves the resistive-wall impedance computations, computes the impedance model
# (can still takes a bit of time) and finally launches the DELPHI computations
# to get instabilities complex tune shifts.
#
# Finally, when all jobs are finished: 
./LHC_compare.py retrieve retrieve
#
# -> this will finally write output files and plots (depending on the scripts).
#
# Note: sometimes there will be a warning, saying that some 'outpickle[...]' file is missing
# The code can still retrieve the results (there will simply be some missing points in the plots...).
# So it is a problem only if too many of such warnings happen, which would mean there is
# a more serious issue (e.g. queue on lxbatch is too short, or computations failed for
# some reason).

# In all these scripts results are put in the folder 
# ../../../DELPHI_results/[machine_name]/[some_name_related_to_the_script]
# You can change this folder at the beginning of the script.

# Scripts are ~always structured as followed:
# - parameters and scanned parameters definition
# - impedance model computation
# - DELPHI computation (sometimes with Sacherer also)
# - plots of results (typically growth_rate vs Q' or vs. intensity, TMCI plots, or stability limis).

##########
# Typical variables that are very often used (see also LHC parameters described above in LHC_param function)
# in these scripts examples:

- beam='1' -> '1' for beam 1, '2' for beam 2
- root_result: directory where to put the results
- flagnorm (always 0): 1 if damper matrix normalized at current chromaticity; 0
  if instead it is normalized at zero chroma (which I almost always assume)
- strnorm (always ['','_norm_current_chroma']): (this never changes...) list with 2 strings:
  at the end of all output files, the string strnorm[flagnorm] is added (it is more or less useless...)
- flagsave: 1 to save figures in .png and .eps files, instead of plotting on screen (0 to plot on screen 
  -> very dangerous since there can be many many plots...)
- flagdamperimp (always 0): 1 to use frequency dependent damper gain (that you have to provide in Zd,fd),
  0 to use a bunch-by-bunch damper
- flagplot: True to plot all impedances during impedance model generation, otherwise False
  (see above in LHC_imp functions) 
- nevery: downsampling of the impedance (take less points than in the full model);
  useful for LHC & HL-LHC v2 models that contain a bit too many points...
- wake_calc: True -> compute wake as well (otherwise only impedance)
- kmax: number of converged eigenvalues in DELPHI convergence process (kmax most unstable ones are 
converged within at worst 5%) -> kmax=1 is enough when we look only at most unstable mode
- kmaxplot: number of kept and plotted eigenvalues (in TMCI plot)
- g,a,b: longitudinal distribution parameters, usually from longdistribution_decomp function (from DELPHI.py) 

- scan definition:
    
    Scans on impedance model parameters (all these scans have same length -> all arrays are corresponding
    to each others):
    * scenarioscan
    * dircollscan
    * legscen
    * squeezescan
    * Escan
    * subscan: subscan of the 5 previous, to select only a few scenarios in the previous without
    redefining everything
    * strsubscan: string to be added to general plots with all these scenarios
    * margin_factor (always 1): factor by which ones multiply all impedances (never used now)
    
    Scans on beam & machine parameters (all these scans are typically done on top of each others ->
    can make up many many calculations - but remember that intensity scan, damper gain and phase scans, and Qs scans
    take no time)
    * Qpscan: scan in chromaticity Q'
    * Qpaver: chromaticities used of final stability limit (in the foreseen scenario)
    * Qpscanplot: chromaticities for which we do plot vs intensity and/or TMCI plots 
    * dampscan: damper gain scan (in 1/number_of_damping_turns)
    * Nbscan: intensity scan (number of particles per bunch)
    * Nbscanplot: intensities for which we do plots vs Qp
    * NbscanHEADTAIL[...]: intensities for which we do a comparison vs HEADTAIL
    NOTE: this typically requires access to N. Mounet local files, so you have to deactivate this by 
    making the array empty
    * Mscan: scan on total number of bunches.


- tuneshiftQp: array of complex tuneshifts with all results, for all scanned parameters and all kmaxplot modes kept
- tuneshiftm0Qp: array of complex tuneshifts for mode 0 only, for all scanned parameters
- imp_mod: full impedance model (list of components, which are impedance_wake objects from the
impedance library in Impedance.py)
- imp_mod_list: complete list of impedance scenarios (list of impedance models)
- wake_mod and wake_mod_list: same but for wakes
